While driving past a park I saw a man and a woman feeding the homeless out of the trunk of their car. They handed out bagels, and cups of juice to all that were near. This made me think of exactly what I could do to make a difference also.{1}{0}On May 22, 2015 I took a step out on faith: {1}{0}I loaded up a Red luggage bag with 30 bag lunches: each with a personalized note of encouragement, water bottle, snacks and sandwich and headed to Washington D.C to hand them out.  It took me 8 hours but I knew something great was started.  Following this weekend I asked a friend to join me, from here the rest is history. {1}{0}2015 was our pilot year, we were able to provide 1,031 meals to those in need. We have grown from a single red luggage bag and a dream to a registered 501c(3).  We spend our time rolling around Washington D.C, Maryland & Virginia looking for the people many people overlook.  It not only brings tears to my eyes but thereâ€™s too when they see that someone cares for them.{1}{0}We hope that this story inspires you to get involved in whatever way possible.{1}{0}Thank you for your time.{1}"},
